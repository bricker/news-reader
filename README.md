# News Reader

A chrome extension which makes reading news better.

It removes all javascript (including paywalls), CSS, images, ads, etc. from popular news sites (eg. CNN, Washington Post). All that's left is the body of the article.

## Roadmap

1. Some attempt at some sort of styling
3. Control Pane (selectively toggle websites, toggle media)
4. Automated integration tests
5. Something that's not regular expressions
6. An iOS App
7. An Android App
